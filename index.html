            <p>Hi! I'm Josh, a graduate from UMKC with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. </p>
            <p> From my experience 
                in school and past projects, I've grown to love computer science as a means for creative solutions to 
                everyday problems and inconveniences. Working a variety of jobs over the years has shown me that I have a 
                passion for putting out fires and solving problems. I'm also looking for a career—if you like what you 
                see and would like to know more, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk. </p>

                            <p>I made this website with entirely html, css, and javascript. It's
                                open source, and you can check out the repository
                                <a href= "https://github.com/josmoo/portfolio" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
                            <p>Building this website gave me the chance to practice more web development. In addition to practicing HTML, CSS, and JS, I had the opportunity 
                                to learn BEM and FLIP animations. Although I didn't fully conform to the former and ended up switching off of FLIP animations to CSS 
                                animations for easier compatibility with Firefox, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about both. There's still a few bugs to be solved,  
                                improvements to be made, and hopefully more projects to add! Thanks for visiting.</p>

                            <p>I created a Voronoi diagram generator in C using SDL2! You can see the source code

                            <p>I had a blast making this application. It was my first time using C (although I've used C++ many times 
                                in the past), and I enjoyed building even the simple components myself. SDL2 was incredibly helpful, but
                                even then I still got to build my own font, and construct my own GUI. Implementing the jump flooding algorithm
                                was also a pleasure. </p>

                                still had fun regardless. It's hosting a static website via TCP. Setting this up also gave me the opportunity to learn

                            <p>I actively maintain a plugin for an open source client called RuneLite. This plugin was 
                                inspired by my own frustrations, but also frustrations of friends. It is currently sitting 
                                at 6,500+ active installs, and users sometimes leave thanks or suggestions for improvements, 
                                which I've appreciated and implemented. In addition to improving its functionality, I've also enjoyed improving the quality 
                                and efficiency of its code over the years. The repository can be seen
