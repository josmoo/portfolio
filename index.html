            <p>Hi! I'm Josh, a graduate from UMKC with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. </p>
            <p> From my experience 
                in school and past projects, I've grown to love computer science as a means for creative solutions to 
                everyday problems and inconveniences. Working a variety of jobs over the years has shown me that I have a 
                passion for putting out fires and solving problems. I'm also looking for a careerâ€”if you like what you 
                see and would like to know more, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk. </p>

                        <p>I actively maintain a plugin for an open source client called RuneLite. This plugin was 
                            inspired by my own frustrations, but also frustrations of friends. It is currently sitting 
                            at 6,500+ active installs, and users sometimes leave thanks or suggestions for improvements, 
                            which I've appreciated and implemented. The repository can be seen
