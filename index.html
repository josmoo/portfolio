            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Josh. I graduated from UMKC with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, and am looking for a job!
                From my experience in school and past projects, I've grown to love computer science as a means for creative solutions to everyday problems and inconveniences.
                Working a variety of jobs of the years has taught me I have a passion for putting out fires and solving problems.  </p>

            <h2>This website!</h2>
            <p>This website was entirely made by myself with html, css, and javascript. It's
                open source, and you can check out the repository on my github</p>

        <div class = "projectCard project2">
            <h2>A youtube playlist searcher!</h2>
            <p>I made a web application from plain html, css, and javascript that accesses YouTube's API to allow users to search a playlist.</p>
            <p>Inspired by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Countless frustrations trying to find <em><b>that one recipe</b></em> in my huge cooking playlist</li>
                <li>Being unable to pinpoint the exact exercise video I've been looking for</li>
                <li>And even just random <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/12xq5i0/can_i_search_in_my_own_playlist/" target="_blank">angry reddit threads</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's free to use, check it out <a href="https://josmoo.github.io/yt-playlist-searcher/" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
            <p>Or if you're more interested in the source code, <a href= "https://github.com/josmoo/yt-playlist-searcher" target="_blank">here's the repository</a>.</p>
