            <p>Hi! I'm Josh, a graduate from UMKC with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. </p>
            <p> From my experience 
                in school and past projects, I've grown to love computer science as a means for creative solutions to 
                everyday problems and inconveniences. Working a variety of jobs over the years has shown me that I have a 
                passion for putting out fires and solving problems. I'm also looking for a careerâ€”if you like what you 
                see and would like to know more, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk. </p>

                            <p>This website was entirely made by myself with html, css, and javascript. It's
                                open source, and you can check out the repository

                            <p>Building this website gave me the chance to practice more web development. It was amazing to learn more about html and css! I had the 
                                opportunity BEM and FLIP animations, although I didn't fully conform to the former. I also ended up switching off of FLIP animations to CSS 
                                animations for easier compatibility with Firefox. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about both. There's still a few bugs to be solved,  
                                improvements to be made, and hopefully more projects to add! Thanks for checking it out.</p>

                            <p>I actively maintain a plugin for an open source client called RuneLite. This plugin was 
                                inspired by my own frustrations, but also frustrations of friends. It is currently sitting 
                                at 6,500+ active installs, and users sometimes leave thanks or suggestions for improvements, 
                                which I've appreciated and implemented. The repository can be seen
